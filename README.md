The project is structured to include multiple test cases, with details and contributions outlined below:

1. SQS Automation Testing:
   Unfortunately, I could not attempt this challenge as I currently lack expertise in AWS.

2. JSON Automation Testing:
   JSONTests.cs: Contains test cases for JSON automation.
   Data Folder: Includes the CodeAnalysis.json file, which provides essential test data required for the JSON tests.
  
3. Calculator Automation Testing:
   Calculator.cs: Implements reusable methods (e.g., addition and subtraction) for use across multiple tests.
   CalculatorTests.cs: Contains test cases for validating calculator functionality using the NUnit framework.
   
4. TestAutomation.cs:
   I identified and noted the following issues in the code:
   The public async Task BatchMessages() method contains an empty foreach loop.
   Some variables are hardcoded, which could be improved by replacing them with dynamic variables.
   While I highlighted these errors, my understanding of AWS and some advanced concepts in the code was limited, preventing me from identifying additional issues.

Additional Comments:
While challenges 1 and 4 remain incomplete due to my limited AWS knowledge, I am confident in my ability to quickly acquire these skills if given the opportunity.
To showcase my expertise in automation and framework design, I am happy to share a sample NUnit framework I developed, which highlights my ability to contribute effectively to this role.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how I can add value to your team.
